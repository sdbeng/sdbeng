### Hi there 👋

** Happy Fall! May God keep you and your family safe and healthy. Happy Thanksgiging and Merry Christmas in advance!!

📫 I work as Full Stack Dev with a team of React and Back end developers. Thank God for this opportunity.
 
📐 2023:♂ Taking a lot of mini breaks, continue reading docs about nextjs13 changes, and planning to build an ai-saas project. Grabbed the new Xcode and SwiftUi, reading the docs and building a project. It looks great so far.

- 💬 On the weekends, I like to spend time with my wife, daugther and son, especially when we go on vacation. We usually play a few games of chess and pickleball, go for walks and play with our husky 🐾
