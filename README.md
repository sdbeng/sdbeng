📐 2024:♂ Taking walks every day helps to out refocus and think on tasks to have a better approach. Reading docs about nextjs15 changes, now building an ai-saas project. Grabbed the new Xcode and SwiftUi, reading the docs and building a project. It looks great so far.

- 💬 On the weekends, I like to spend time with my wife, daugther and son, especially when we go on camping vacation. We usually play a few games of chess and tennis, go for walks and play with our husky 🐾
