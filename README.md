### Hi there 👋

** 08-2021: Hi everybody! It's the beggining of a new season, happy fall!.

📫 Good News!!! I'm working as FS Dev with a team of React and Back end developers.

On pause- Concord Bootcamp meetup. Started meetings on 7-28-2021, I had to move up to a different day due to a FS project. Go ahead, check out my linkedin profile, and come join us!! It's great to build and serve our own communities and share our knowledge  🙌

** 03-2021: WIP on a nextjs e-commerce application 📐

** 🌱 01-02-2021: Work done #60daysofswiftuicode!! ** 🚀
- 💬 On the weekends, I like to spend time with my wife, daugther and son, play a few games of chess, go for walks and play with our little husky 🐾
