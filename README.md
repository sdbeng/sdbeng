### Hi there 👋

** Happy almost Spring! May God keep you and your family safe and healthy.

📫 I work as Full Stack Dev with a team of amazing developers. Our stack is React.js, Redux Toolkit and SpringBoot. Thank God for this opportunity and future ones.
 
📐 2024:♂ Taking walks evry day helps me out refocus and think on tasks to have a better approach. Continue reading docs about nextjs14 changes, and now building an ai-saas project. Grabbed the new Xcode and SwiftUi, reading the docs and building a project. It looks great so far.

- 💬 On the weekends, I like to spend time with my wife, daugther and son, especially when we go on vacation. We usually play a few games of chess and tennis, go for walks and play with our husky 🐾
